She spent most of her early life in Northumberland planning to be a musician but did a rather unexpected U-turn at the age of 18, and after a brief foray into teaching ended up reading physics at Oxford University. She was awarded her PhD in 2009 in particle physics, and spent a few subsequent years hunting particles in the ATLAS detector as part of the LHC project. Looking for a new challenge, she then took a job as a field engineer at MathWorks, the company behind MATLAB, specialising in statistics and parallel computing. In her spare time she likes to do anything that involves being outdoors in the sunshine.", "info": "Data Scientist, Pivotal", "name": "Ellie Dobson", "imgsrc": "http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/en/assets/1/eventprovider/1/_@user_193625.jpg"}, "/big-data-conference-uk-2015/public/schedule/speaker/193620": {"url": "http://strataconf.com//big-data-conference-uk-2015/public/schedule/speaker/193620", "bio": "Website | @dmoralesdf\r\n\r\n\r\n | Attendee Directory Profile\n\nWorking as a big data architect at Stratio, David Morales has been involved in the inception and evolution of some modules included in the Stratio platform, especially those related to data visualization, real-time, streaming, and complex event proccesing.", "info": "Big Data Architect, STRATIO", "name": "David Morales"}}
